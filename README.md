# Algorithms
Here I will take you on the journey with me learning all kinds of Algorithms and Data structures, mainly for Competitive programming

So I will devide the differend Algorithms in these Categories:
1. Graph Algorithms
2. Dynamic Programming
3. Search & Sorting
4. Prime Number & Prime Factorization
5. Modulo Arithmetic Algorithms
6. Miscellaneous
7. Geometrical & Network flow Algorithms
